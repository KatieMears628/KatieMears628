## Hi there 👋 I'm Katie! 

🔭 I’m currently working on a capstone project for my final course in my masters program, M.S. Applied Data Science. Graduating in December 2024 
> The objective for this project is to quantify the impact of weather conditions on traffic congestion and accident risk, enabling a deeper understanding of how variables such as precipitation, temperature, and visibility affect the number of auto accidents.
