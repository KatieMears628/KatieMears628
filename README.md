## Hi there 👋 I'm Katie! 


With a passion for integrating quality control in life sciences and data analytics, I have a strong background in ensuring product integrity within the medical device industry. In my career, I am focused on data-driven post-market surveillance. By leveraging data trending and analysis, I’ve contributed to enhancing our post-market strategies, ensuring consumer safety and improving product quality.

In January 2023, I began a master’s degree in applied data science at the University of San Diego, driven by my enthusiasm for data’s transformative potential. This program is expanding my skills and deepening my understanding of data-driven insights and innovation.

🔭 I’m currently working on a capstone project for my final course in my masters program: Risk-Based Premiums and Real-Time Safety Guidance for Auto Insurance Customer Retention
> The objective for this project is to quantify the impact of weather conditions on traffic congestion and accident risk, enabling a deeper understanding of how variables such as precipitation, temperature, and visibility affect the number of auto accidents.
