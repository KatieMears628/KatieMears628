## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Katie! 



ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a capstone project for my final course in my masters program: Risk-Based Premiums and Real-Time Safety Guidance for Auto Insurance Customer Retention
> The objective for this project is to quantify the impact of weather conditions on traffic congestion and accident risk, enabling a deeper understanding of how variables such as precipitation, temperature, and visibility affect the number of auto accidents.
