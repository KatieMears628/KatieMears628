## Hi there 👋 I'm Katie! 


With a passion for integrating quality control and data analytics in life sciences, I bring a strong background in ensuring product integrity within the medical device industry. My career is centered on data-driven post-market surveillance, where I leverage data trending and analysis to enhance post-market strategies, safeguard consumer safety, and drive improvements in product quality.

In January 2023, I began a master’s degree program in Applied Data Science at the University of San Diego, motivated by the transformative potential of data. This program is expanding my analytical capabilities and deepening my understanding of data-driven innovation.

🔭 Current Project: My master’s capstone focuses on Risk-Based Premiums and Real-Time Safety Guidance for Auto Insurance. The objective is to quantify how weather conditions impact traffic congestion and accident risk, examining variables like precipitation, temperature, and visibility to better understand their influence on accident rates. This project aims to support dynamic, risk-based insurance pricing and provide actionable insights for real-time safety guidance.
